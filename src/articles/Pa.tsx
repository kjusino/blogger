        <h2>Maunabo, PR</h2>,
        <p>
            My father, Luis, was born in Rio Piedras and raised in the rural
            mountain town of Maunabo, Puerto Rico. He and his five siblings were
            raised by a single mother, with the help of Luis' grandmother who
            lived nearby on a farm. Pa grew up only speaking Spanish, as most
            poor Puerto Ricans do on the island. He and his siblings used to
            have to climb down the mountain with large buckets to fill them up
            with freshwater before carrying them back up to the house to be
            used. Pa used to tell us stories of him skipping school with his
            cousins so they all could go to the nearby beaches to cool off.
        </p>,
        <p>
            Pa distinctly remembers his grandmother on her farm, living off of
            the land and animals she cared for. He even recalls her grabbing
            tobacco leaves off of nearby greenery and rolling her own cigars,
            exactly how the native Tainos had done for thousands of years on the
            island. After a 23&Me test, my father was found to be ~20% native
            Taino, even further supporting his claim of his grandmother placing
            feathers in her hair as she'd care for the animals.
        </p>,
        <p>
            At 18 years old, Luis joined the United States Military. This is
            very common, especially of the poorest Puerto Rican's, who's only
            real shot of getting out of poverty is through the military
            industrial complex. It usually includes a free ticket to the
            mainland, which he had never visited, shelter, and steady pay. So my
            dad packed his bags, said goodbye to his home, and went off seeking
            a better life in the United States.
        </p>,
        <h2> El Hombre</h2>,
        <p>
            Upon joining the military, my dad was shipped to Texas for basic
            training. He told us of the grueling drill sergeants, and horrible
            desert conditions: 110 degrees during the day, and sub 50 degrees at
            night. And at any time, they could be asked to drop everything they
            were doing and run 5 miles, rain or shine.
        </p>,
        <p>
            During his leave, my father needed to work to support himself. He
            had family members living around the country, so he would visit them
            and work whatever jobs he could find. He visited cities like
            Chicago, IL and Lawrence, MA. He even worked removing Asbestos from
            the Prudential Tower in downtown Boston in the 90's. Somehow, my
            father found his way to Providence, RI, where he worked in the
            factories famous at the time. It was grueling work, and took a toll
            on him physically.
        </p>,
        <p>
            He met my mother at Rhode Island College, where they both attended
            English as a Second Language classes at night after working all day
            in the textile factories. It wasnt love at first sight, but it was
            close. After an accident at the factory cost him his right hands'
            index finger, my father realized he did not want to continue
            struggling through life working odd jobs that hurt him physically.
            He knew he was intelligent, and should put that to use. So he did.
        </p>,
        <h2> El Biólogo</h2>,
        <p>
            With dreams of understanding life and the nature he had been raised
            surrounded by, my father enrolled in undergraduate Biology classes
            at Rhode Island College before transferring to the University of
            Rhode Island. There, he declared his major in Biology and minor in
            Nutrition. My father learned about mitochondria, cytoplasms, golgi
            apparatus and all parts of the cell, with interests in diseases and
            proteins. He was in love. My mother was ill for a few months after
            my birth, so my dad used to take me to class with him at URI, where
            I would sit strapped to his chest while he was taking notes.
        </p>,
        <p>
            His determination to be the first in his entire family to get a
            college degree and his desire for a stable life drove him to
            accomplish what no one thought was possible, to graduation. My
            father used his biologicial interests and newly gained skills to
            create his own consuling firm, where he worked as a Nutritionist to
            those seeking a healthier lifestyle. While we lived in the Dominican
            Republic, he would advise strangers, friends, and family on the
            effects of our Caribbean diets on a persons long term health, the
            dangers of a sedentary lifestyle, and the lifechanging benefits of
            regular physical activity, even appearing on the front page of Santo
            Domingo's largest newspaper as "The Nutrionist". He especially made
            sure his children learned the lessons he had spent his lifetime
            learning so they would not have to struggle like he did. He
            emphasized the importance of health and education, and continues to
            do so to this day.

        <h2> El Papá</h2>,
        <p>
            My father was raised by a single mother, with no father figures
            except a few uncles. I have always greatly admired my father,
            because he has been the best father in the world to his children,
            unlike the father he never had. So its even more impressive how
            great of a father he has been my entire life, purely driven by love
            for his kids and his wife. He taught me how to be a man, a good man,
            and how to get shit done. My father never waited for anybody to do
            something for him. He wanted something done? He did it himself at
            that very moment and would take us with him to home depot to get the
            tools and pieces for whatever project he was working on.
        </p>,
        <p>
            He built the house we lived in for the majority of my life, and
            fixed almost everything broken or not working himself. He did
            homework with us every day until he could no longer help with the
            material. He taught me how to ride a bike, and would go on long
            rides with my brother and I on bike paths near the house. He didnt
            even get mad at me when I dumbly crossed in front of him and knocked
            his bike off balance, throwing him to the ground and bleeding from
            his arm. He was patient, and loved us more than he was mad. He took
            us to Roger Williams Park to play baseball and eat pizza, and
            watched the SciFi channel with us for hours. He'd make dinner on
            school nights after working long days at the Diocese, and he'd stay
            up late helping us with school projects due the next day (sorry for
            the late notice). He was one of my participants in my science fair
            projects, and he was always who I asked my science questions to. He
            almost always knew the answer, and when he didnt know, he would say
            he didnt know and encourage me to find out the answer for both of
            us.
        </p>,
        <p>
            He taught me to follow my passions, even when what I was interested
            in was "nerdy". He was estatic when I went to and graduated from
            college, and taught me to never stop learning. He made me curious
            about the world and how it works, and I am the man I am today
            because of his example. I was raised by a real man, who was never
            afraid of letting his kids know he loved them and would be there for
            anything. I dont know where I would be without my father in my life,
            and I will love him for the rest of mine.
        </p>,
        <p>
            Thank you for being the best father in the world, and for raising us
            in your image. Thank you for teaching me science and math, and
            encouraging me to go after my dreams. I will do the same, and
            encourage you to chase your dreams too. Return to school, learn
            more, change careers, go on vacations, eat food (and then exercise),
            and enjoy everything life has to offer. My father is my best friend,
            and I wish him a Happy Fathers Day! I love you, Pa!
