        <h2> The Beginning </h2>,
        <p>
            I was born in Providence, RI to a Dominican mother and a Puerto
            Rican father. They met in the 1990's while enrolled in
            English-as-a-Second Language night classes offered by Rhode Island
            College. After my younger brother was born, our family moved to
            Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, so my parents could leverage
            their familial support network back in the Caribbean during my
            childhood. It was an amazing way to grow up, surrounded by{' '}
            <em>hundreds</em> of family members and friends, all gathered for
            even the smallest occasions.
        </p>,
        <p>
            I learned Spanish as my first language, and we practiced our English
            at home. After my seventh birthday and fifth year in Santo Domingo,
            my parents made the difficult decision to return to Rhode Island
            after economic harships began to affect everyday life in DR. I didnt
            even know what a coat was, let alone what awaited us in the United
            States.

            Upon returning to Providence, I began attending{' '}
            <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/rhode-island/alfred-lima-sr-elementary-school-278884">
                Alfred Lima Elementary
            </a>
            , a bilingual public school where many first generation students in
            Providence pass through. I later arrived at{' '}
            <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/rhode-island/districts/providence-public-schools/times2-middle-high-school-409586">
                Times Squared Academy
            </a>
            , the charter school I graduated high school from before attending
            college. Growing up in Providence was a unique experience,
            surrounded by the children of minorities from the Caribbean, Central
            and South America, and Africa.
        </p>,
        <p>
            Living in a city and attending a school where the majority of people
            are minorities built a perspective within me to look at situations
            from the eyes of those who have just arrived to the United States.
            We learned the customs and the language, and partook in American
            traditions while still being nestled in Providence's community
            bubble.
