            Learning to do the mathematics of programming is the most crucial
            part of the job. The rest is just syntax. So why do so many wannabe
            programmers skip the math and go straight to the syntax? Because
            it's hard. But it's also the most important part of the job.

            So, if you want to be a good programmer, you need to learn the math
            first. Then, you can learn the syntax. And then, you can learn the
            rest of the job. But if you skip the math, you'll never be a good
            programmer. You'll just be a code monkey. And nobody wants to be a
            code monkey.
